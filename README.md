# Jerrycurl - Razor-powered ORM for SQL lovers
**Jerrycurl** is an MVC-based **ORM** that focuses on elegant and type-safe **SQL** written with **Razor syntax**.
```sql
@result CustomerStatsView
@model CustomerFilter
@project Order o

SELECT
    @R.Star(),
    @R.Star(m => m.Address),
    (
        SELECT  COUNT(*)
        FROM    @o.Tbl()
        WHERE   @o.Col(m => m.CustomerId) = @R.Col(m => m.Id)
    )   AS @R.Prop(m => m.NumberOfOrders)
FROM
    @R.Tbl()
LEFT JOIN
    @R.Tbl(m => m.Address) ON @R.Col(m => m.Address.Id) = @R.Col(m => m.AddressId)
WHERE
    @R.Col(m => m.CreatedDate) >= @M.Par(m => m.CreatedAfter)
ORDER BY
    @R.Col(m => m.CreatedDate) DESC
```

## Features
* Official support for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and SQLite
* CLI tool to easily generate classes from your database schema

## Building from source
Jerrycurl can be built on any OS supported by .NET Core and included in this repository is a script that performs all build related tasks.

### Prerequisites
* .NET Core SDK 3.0
* .NET Core Runtime 2.1+ / 3.0 (to run tests)
* PowerShell 5.0+ (PowerShell Core on Linux/macOS) 
* Visual Studio 2019 (16.3+) (optional)
* Docker (optional - for vendor testing)

### Clone and Build
Clone the repository and run our build script from PowerShell.
```powershell
PS> git clone https://github.com/rwredding/jerrycurl
PS> cd jerrycurl
PS> .\build.ps1 [-NoTest] [-NoPack]
```
This runs the `Restore`, `Clean`, `Build`, `[Test]` and `[Pack]` targets on `jerrycurl.sln`. Each target can also be run manually in Visual Studio if preferred.

> Packaged `.nupkgs` are placed in `/artifacts/packages`.

### Test
The script above *cannot include all tests* out of the box, as those testing specific databases often require a live running server. To help you include these in your run, you can use our [`docker compose` script](test/tools/boot-dbs.ps1) with PowerShell to boot up instances of the required databases.

```powershell
PS> .\test\tools\boot-dbs.ps1 up sqlserver,mysql,postgres,oracle
```
Please allow ~30 seconds for the databases to be ready after which you can re-run your tests.

> Oracle Database requires that you are logged into Docker and have accepted their [terms of service](https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition).

> If you already have an empty database running that can be used for testing, you can manually specify its connection string in the environment variable `JERRY_SQLSERVER_CONN`, `JERRY_MYSQL_CONN`, `JERRY_POSTGRES_CONN` or `JERRY_ORACLE_CONN`.
