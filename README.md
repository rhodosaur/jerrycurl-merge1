# Jerrycurl - Razor SQL for .NET
**Jerrycurl** is a lightweight and highly customizable **object-relational mapper** with emphasis on writing elegant and performant **SQL** with **Razor** and **C#**.

```sql
@result MyShop.Data.Views.Orders.OrderUnsentInvoiceView
@model MyShop.Data.Models.CustomerParams

@project Order o
@project Customer c

SELECT
    @o.Col(m => m.InvoiceNumber)        AS @R.Prop(m => m.InvoiceNumber),
    @o.Col(m => m.Completed)            AS @R.Prop(m => m.InvoiceDate),
    @c.Col(m => m.Email)                AS @R.Prop(m => m.CustomerEmail),
    @c.Col(m => m.Address)              AS @R.Prop(m => m.CustomerAddress)
FROM
    @o.Tbl()
INNER JOIN
    @c.Tbl() ON @c.Col(m => m.Id) = @o.Col(m => m.CustomerId)
WHERE
    @o.Col(m => m.CustomerId) = @M.Par(m => m.CustomerId)
    AND
    @o.Col(m => m.Sent) IS NULL
    AND
    @o.Col(m => m.Completed) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    @o.Col(m => m.Completed) ASC
```

## Features
* Beautiful and injection-safe Razor syntax with SQL and strongly typed C#
* Blazingly fast queries with `one-to-one`, `one-to-none`, `one-to-many`, `many-to-many` and `self-join` support
* Simple batch generation with Razor `@foreach`
* Reusable subqueries and subcommands with Razor *partials* and *templates*
* Easily maintainable, ASP.NET-like projects with [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
* High decoupling with [command-query separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation)
* JSON support with `Newtonsoft.Json` or `System.Text.Json`
* Integration with Entity Framework Core models
* Modern language features with .NET Standard 2.0 and 2.1
* ...and more

To learn more about Jerrycurl and how to get started, read [our official docs](https://jerrycurl.net/docs) or check our [sample repo](https://github.com/rwredding/jerrycurl-sample).

## Building from source
Jerrycurl can be built on any OS supported by .NET Core and included in this repository is a build script that performs all build related tasks.

### Prerequisites
* .NET Core SDK 3.0
* .NET Core Runtime 2.1+ / 3.0 (to run tests)
* PowerShell 5.0+ (PowerShell Core on Linux/macOS) 
* Visual Studio 2019 (16.3+) (optional)
* Docker (optional - for vendor testing)

### Clone and Build
Clone the repository and run our build script from PowerShell.
```powershell
PS> git clone https://github.com/rwredding/jerrycurl
PS> cd jerrycurl
PS> .\build.ps1 [-NoTest] [-NoPack]
```
This runs the `Restore`, `Clean`, `Build`, `[Test]` and `[Pack]` targets on `jerrycurl.sln`. Each target can also be run manually in Visual Studio if preferred.

> Packaged `.nupkgs` are placed in `/artifacts/packages`.

### Test
The script above runs most tests, but will **skip those** that require a live running database server. To enable these you can run our [`docker compose` script](test/tools/boot-dbs.ps1) with PowerShell to boot up instances of our supported databases.

```powershell
PS> .\test\tools\boot-dbs.ps1 up sqlserver,mysql,postgres,oracle
```
Please allow ~30 seconds for the databases to be ready after which you can re-run your tests.

> Oracle Database requires that you are logged into Docker and have accepted their [terms of service](https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition).

> If you already have an empty database running that can be used for testing, you can manually specify its connection string in the environment variable `JERRY_SQLSERVER_CONN`, `JERRY_MYSQL_CONN`, `JERRY_POSTGRES_CONN` or `JERRY_ORACLE_CONN`.
