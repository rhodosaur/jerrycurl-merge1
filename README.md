# Jerrycurl - Razor-powered ORM for .NET
**Jerrycurl** is a free and lightweight **ORM for .NET** that focuses on elegant and type-safe **SQL** written with **Razor syntax**.
```sql
-- Queries/Customers/GetStats.cssql
@result CustomerStatsView
@model CustomerFilter
@project Order o

SELECT
    @R.Star(),
    @R.Star(m => m.Address),
    (
        SELECT  COUNT(*)
        FROM    @o.Tbl()
        WHERE   @o.Col(m => m.CustomerId) = @R.Col(m => m.Id)
    )   AS @R.Prop(m => m.NumberOfOrders)
FROM
    @R.Tbl()
LEFT JOIN
    @R.Tbl(m => m.Address) ON @R.Col(m => m.Address.Id) = @R.Col(m => m.AddressId)
WHERE
    @R.Col(m => m.CreatedDate) >= @M.Par(m => m.CreatedAfter)
ORDER BY
    @R.Col(m => m.CreatedDate) DESC
```

It allows you to build robust data access layers around ASP.NET-like **MVC** and **CQS** conventions that organizes your code into models, queries, commands and **accessors**.

```csharp
// Accessors/CustomersAccessor.cs
public class CustomersAccessor : Accessor
{
    public IList<CustomerStatsView> GetStats(DateTime createdAfter)
    {
        var filter = new CustomerFilter
        {
            CreatedAfter = createdAfter,
        };
        
        return this.Query<CustomerStatsView>(model: filter);
    }
}
```

To learn more about Jerrycurl and how to get started, read [our official docs](https://jerrycurl.net/documentation) or check our [samples repo](https://github.com/rwredding/jerrycurl-samples).

## Building from source
Jerrycurl can be built on [any OS supported by .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/dependencies) and included in this repository is a [script](build.ps1) that performs all build-related tasks.

### Prerequisites
* .NET Core SDK 3.0
* .NET Core Runtime 2.1+ / 3.0 (to run tests)
* PowerShell 5.0+ (PowerShell Core on Linux/macOS) 
* Visual Studio 2019 (16.3+) (optional)
* Docker (optional - for live database testing)

### Clone, Build and Test
Clone the repository and run our build script from PowerShell.
```powershell
PS> git clone https://github.com/rwredding/jerrycurl
PS> cd jerrycurl
PS> .\build.ps1 [-NoTest] [-NoPack]
```

This runs the `Restore`, `Clean`, `Build`, `[Test]` and `[Pack]` targets on `jerrycurl.sln` and places any packaged `.nupkg` in the `/artifacts/packages` folder. Each target can also be run manually in Visual Studio if preferred.

By default, the `Test` target skips any test that requires live running database server. To help you to include these, you can use our [`docker compose` script](test/tools/boot-dbs.ps1) to boot up instances of our supported databases.

```powershell
PS> .\test\tools\boot-dbs.ps1 up sqlserver,mysql,postgres,oracle
```

Please allow ~60 seconds for the databases to be ready after which you can re-run `build.ps1`; it will then automatically target the included databases instances. When done, you can tear everything down again.

```powershell
PS> .\test\tools\boot-dbs.ps1 down sqlserver,mysql,postgres,oracle
```

> If you already have an empty database running that can be used for testing, you can manually specify its connection string in the environment variable `JERRY_SQLSERVER_CONN`, `JERRY_MYSQL_CONN`, `JERRY_POSTGRES_CONN` or `JERRY_ORACLE_CONN`.

> Pulling the Oracle Database image requires that you are logged into Docker and have accepted their [terms of service](https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition).
