# Jerrycurl - MVC and Razor-powered ORM for .NET

**Jerrycurl** is an object-relational framework that allows developers to build **robust data access** in a way similar to how web applications are built with **ASP.NET MVC**.

It provides a **customized MVC structure** that separates your project into domains, models, accessors and procedures written with our
specialized **Razor SQL** syntax.

### Procedure (view) layer
Procedures are written in `.cssql` files and separated into **commands** that write data and **queries** that read data. Both are written with a combination of **SQL and Razor code** that generate SQL and parameters from typesafe projections of your object model.
```
-- Queries/Movies/GetMovies.cssql
@result MovieTaglineView
@model MovieFilter
@project MovieDetails d

SELECT     @R.Star(),
           @d.Col(m => m.Tagline) AS @R.Prop(m => m.Tagline)
FROM       @R.Tbl()
LEFT JOIN  @d.Tbl() ON @d.Col(m => m.MovieId) = @R.Col(m => m.Id)
WHERE      @R.Col(m => m.Year) >= @M.Par(m => m.SinceYear)
```
```
-- Commands/Movies/AddMovies.cssql
@model Movie

@foreach (var v in this.M.Vals())
{
    INSERT INTO @v.TblName() ( @v.In().ColNames() )
    OUTPUT      @v.Out().Cols("INSERTED").As().Props()
    VALUES                   ( @v.In().Pars() )
}
```

### Model layer
Models are simple POCO-like classes that can be combined into complete object graphs that represents *all* data for a certain operation. Each model can be mapped at any depth with any type of data relationship: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and self-joins.
```csharp
// Database.cs
[Table("dbo", "Movie")]
class Movie
{
    [Id, Key("PK_Movie")]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}
```
```csharp
// Views/Movies/MovieTaglineView.cs
class MovieTaglineView : Movie
{
    public string Tagline { get; set; }
}
```

### Accessor (controller) layer
Accessors provide the bridge from your code to the consumer by exposing a collection of methods that each executes a Razor command or query and maps its resulting data sets to matching objects.
```csharp
// Accessors/MoviesAccessor.cs
public class MoviesAccessor : Accessor
{
    public IList<MovieTaglineView> GetMovies(int sinceYear) // -> Queries/Movies/GetMovies.cssql
        => this.Query<MovieTaglineView>(model: new MovieFilter { SinceYear = sinceYear });
    
    public void AddMovies(IList<Movie> newMovies) // -> Commands/Movies/AddMovies.cssql
        => this.Execute(model: newMovies);
}
```

### Domain (application) layer
Domains provide a central place for fetching configuration for any (or a subset of) your database operations.
```csharp
class MovieDomain : IDomain
{
    public void Configure(DomainOptions options)
    {
        options.UseSqlServer("SERVER=.;DATABASE=moviedb;TRUSTED_CONNECTION=true");
        options.UseJson();
    }
}
```

## Building from source
Jerrycurl can be built on [any OS supported by .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/dependencies) and included in this repository is a [script](build.ps1) that performs all build-related tasks.

### Prerequisites
* .NET Core SDK 3.0
* .NET Core Runtime 2.1+ / 3.0 (to run tests)
* PowerShell 5.0+ (PowerShell Core on Linux/macOS) 
* Visual Studio 2019 (16.3+) (optional)
* Docker (optional - for live database testing)

### Clone, Build and Test
Clone the repository and run our build script from PowerShell.
```powershell
PS> git clone https://github.com/rwredding/jerrycurl
PS> cd jerrycurl
PS> .\build.ps1 [-NoTest] [-NoPack]
```

This runs the `Restore`, `Clean`, `Build`, `[Test]` and `[Pack]` targets on `jerrycurl.sln` and places any packaged `.nupkg` in the `/artifacts/packages` folder. Each target can also be run manually in Visual Studio if preferred.

By default, the `Test` target skips any unit test that requires live running database server. To help you to include these, you can run our [`docker compose` script](test/tools/boot-dbs.ps1) to boot up instances of our supported databases.

```powershell
PS> .\test\tools\boot-dbs.ps1 up sqlserver,mysql,postgres,oracle
```

Please allow ~60 seconds for the databases to be ready after which you can re-run `build.ps1`; it will then automatically target the included databases instances. When done, you can tear everything down again.

```powershell
PS> .\test\tools\boot-dbs.ps1 down sqlserver,mysql,postgres,oracle
```

> If you already have an empty database running that can be used for testing, you can manually specify its connection string in the environment variable `JERRY_SQLSERVER_CONN`, `JERRY_MYSQL_CONN`, `JERRY_POSTGRES_CONN` or `JERRY_ORACLE_CONN`.

> Pulling the Oracle Database image requires that you are logged into Docker and have accepted their [terms of service](https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition).
